# MoonSafe Meter Submission System

This document explains how to set up and use the token submission system for the MoonSafe Meter.

## Overview

The submission system allows users to submit tokens for community review. All submissions require admin approval before they appear on the website. The system includes:

- **User Submission Form**: A modal form where users can submit tokens
- **Admin Panel**: A management interface for reviewing and approving/rejecting submissions
- **Database Integration**: Supabase backend for storing and managing submissions

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database_setup.sql`
4. Run the script to create the necessary table and policies

### 2. Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file contains the necessary Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS)

The system uses RLS policies to control access:
- Anyone can submit tokens (INSERT)
- Only approved tokens are publicly visible (SELECT with status = 'approved')
- Authenticated users can read all submissions and update status (for admin panel)

## How It Works

### User Submission Process

1. Users click the "ðŸš€ Submit Token" button in the MoonSafe Meter section
2. A modal form opens with fields for:
   - Token Name
   - Token Address
   - Submitter Name
   - Submitter Telegram or Discord (required)
   - Description
   - Token Social Links (required - must include X or Telegram)
3. Users fill out the form and submit
4. The submission is stored in the database with status 'pending'
5. Users receive a success message

### Admin Review Process

1. Admins access the admin panel via the "ðŸ”§ Admin Panel" button (top-right corner)
2. The admin panel shows all submissions with filtering options:
   - Pending Review
   - Approved
   - Rejected
   - All Submissions
3. For pending submissions, admins can:
   - Add admin notes
   - Approve the submission
   - Reject the submission
4. Status changes are recorded with timestamps

## Database Schema

### token_submissions Table

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | BIGSERIAL | Primary key |
| token_name | VARCHAR(255) | Name of the token |
| token_address | VARCHAR(255) | Contract address |
| submitter_name | VARCHAR(255) | Name of person submitting |
| submitter_contact | VARCHAR(255) | Telegram or Discord contact (required) |
| description | TEXT | Detailed description |
| social_links | TEXT | Social media links (required - must include X or Telegram) |
| status | VARCHAR(50) | 'pending', 'approved', or 'rejected' |
| admin_notes | TEXT | Notes from admin review |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | When submitted |
| reviewed_at | TIMESTAMP | When reviewed |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Last update |

## Customization

### Styling
- All components use CSS modules
- Colors and styling match the MoonSafe theme
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### Form Fields
You can easily add or modify form fields by:
1. Updating the form state in `TokenSubmissionForm.jsx`
2. Adding the field to the database schema
3. Updating the submission function in `supabase.js`

### Admin Access
Currently, admin access is controlled by a simple toggle button. For production:
1. Implement proper authentication
2. Add role-based access control
3. Secure the admin panel with login requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Check your Supabase credentials
   - Verify the table exists
   - Check RLS policies

2. **Submissions Not Saving**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify form validation
   - Check database permissions

3. **Admin Panel Not Loading**
   - Check authentication status
   - Verify RLS policies for authenticated users
   - Check network connectivity

### Debug Mode

Enable console logging by checking the browser console for detailed error messages and API responses.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the submission system:

1. **Email Notifications**: Send emails when submissions are approved/rejected
2. **Image Uploads**: Allow users to upload token logos or screenshots
3. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated search and filter options
4. **Bulk Operations**: Approve/reject multiple submissions at once
5. **Analytics**: Track submission statistics and trends
6. **Moderation Queue**: Priority system for urgent submissions
7. **Community Voting**: Allow community members to vote on submissions
